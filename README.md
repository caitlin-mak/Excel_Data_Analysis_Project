# My Excel Data Analysis Projects

## Introduction 

This project brings together two data analysis tasks designed to develop and demonstrate my analytical skills in Excel. While I followed Luke Barousse's [Excel Data Analytics Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/excel), I chose to work with different datasets so challenge myself and ensure I could apply these skills independently.

## Datasets Used

__Goodreads Project__: 
- [__Goodreads Book Graph Datasets__](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/goodreads.html) by the University of California San Diego
- __Collected__: 2017.
- It includes information on:
    - Book Titles
    - Authors
    - Average Ratings
    - Rating Counts
    - Genres 

__UFO Sightings Project__:

- [__UFO Sightings__](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings) by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).
- __Collected__: 2014
- It includes information on sightings such as the:
    - Exact date
    - State
    - Duration 
    - Type 

## Key Skills Learned

Throughout this project, I developed and refined my skills in Excel in the following areas:

- Charts
- Formulas and Functions
- Data Validation
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts 
- DAX (Data Analysis Expression)
- Power Query 
- Power Pivot

## Summary of Analyses

[__Goodreads Data Analysis__](Goodreads_Project/Goodreads_Data_Analysis.xlsx)

- Explored author performance, 5-star proportions, genre popularity and book length variation

[__UFO Sightings Dashboard__](UFO_Sightings_Project/USA_UFO_Dashboard.xlsx)
- Visualised regional patterns, yearly trends, sightings shapes and sighting durations

## Reflection

This project enabled me to strengthen my Excel skills in multiple areas:  
- I developed a deeper understanding of Power Query and Power Pivot, particularly how to clean, transform and structure data before analysis.
- I gained confidence using Excel functions such as SORTBY, FILTER, and COUNTIFS, especially when creating formulas that adapt to user selections.
- Creating dynamic elements such as the state filter, visualisation type filter and metric cards helped me learn to design dashboards that are intuitive and easy to navigate. This also taught me the importance of selecting the right chart type for each kind of data.
- Using datasets that were not provided in the course allowed me to apply every technique independently. This meant I had to understand why each formula or measure was needed, rather than simply reproducting steps from a tutorial.

Overall, this project has improved my knowledge and confidence in using Excel to complete end-to-end analyses without relying on guided examples. I now feel well-prepared to take on new datasets and apply the skills I have learned.
